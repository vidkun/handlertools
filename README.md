handlertools
============

Collection of tools for common incident handling lookups. Will be hosted at www.handlertools.com for public use.

Most of the original code was written by jmilner. I've cleaned it up some and repurposed for everyone to use.
I'll be adding some extra features as time permits. First up is adding VirusTotal lookups.

If you have any fixes or extra features you'd like to see added, please submit a pull request and I'll be happy
to look at adding them.
